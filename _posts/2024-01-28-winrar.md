WinRAR is probably one of the most recognisable pieces of software out there. Whether you're 50+ years old or a
software developer in their early 20s, you've most likely used it, and can probably even recall its name when you need
to download it again to a new computer.

    </a>
</div>

Why am I writing about it, though? Why is it interesting at all?. Well, I personally use WinRAR for handling lots of
compressed files on a daily basis, generally because I have to create, monitor, and distribute deployment pipelines,
which involve ZIP files and other types of compressed media.

Because of the heavy use I give it (and because I always wanted to be able to say that I owned a WinRAR copy lol), I
decided to contact them via e-mail, just to ask whether I could have a personal use licence. Here,
[Louise Cusworth](https://de.linkedin.com/in/louise-cusworth-428670b2) answered me directly, and we exchanged several
e-mails from this point onwards. 

After some back and forth with Louise, I ended up purchasing a digital copy of WinRAR plus the physical CD!.
Of course, this goes beyond the software itself I mean, it's not like I *needed* anything here; I just found it very
cool to be able to get such a novelty item after personally speaking with someone via e-mail haha.

Months went by after we concluded our e-mail conversation on October 27th, until, on December 14th, I received a letter
in the mail directly from Berlin, Germany!. It looked like this:

<div class="popup-post" align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/winrar/letter.png">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/winrar/letter.png" alt="" width="80%">
    </a>
</div>

<br/>

<div class="popup-post" align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/winrar/letter2.png">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/winrar/letter2.png" alt="" width="80%">
    </a>
</div>

<br/>

<div class="popup-post" align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/winrar/stamp.png">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/winrar/stamp.png" alt="" width="30%">
    </a>
</div>

<br/>

There was something odd about it, though. This letter didn't contain the CD I had ordered, but rather something even
more special, in my opinion at least haha. Inside the envelope came a big RARLAB sticker, with the word "WinRAR" written
in the centre, and their quote "the small survive" in small letters right underneath it. Here's a picture of everything
put together:

<div class="popup-post" align="center">
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/winrar/allthings.png">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/posts/winrar/allthings.png" alt="" width="80%">
    </a>
</div>

<br/>

All things considered, I'm still hoping the CD pops in my mail one of these days haha, but the level of detail and care
put into writing a letter, signing it, getting a nice-looking sticker to go with it... these kinds of things go a long
way with me, and I believe I've got exactly what I was looking for without even knowing: a cool novelty item with an
interesting story behind it that I can now share with you all!

Thank you, RARLAB, for keeping this software legend alive, and to Louise for turning this into quite the experience for
me!.
