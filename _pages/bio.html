        <p>
            I'm José Benavente, the software developer behind the “BGM” pseudonym. I'm a recent graduate of Execution
            Engineering in Computing and Informatics, and a very passionate teacher. I work on a series of voluntary
            initiatives which range from building and leading technical communities, to low level software development
            contributing to a video game called Re-Volt, from 1999. I'm currently also a part-time teacher at
            the University of the Bío-Bío.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love translating software, reading technical books, calligraphy, fountain pens, and racing games!
